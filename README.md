🧾 Project Title: Employee Payroll System (Java) live on : https://replit.com/@swarajhunde/EmployeePayRollSystem



Description:

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based application designed to manage employee details and calculate their salaries efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to handle different types of employees and their respective payroll computations.

The system consists of classes for different employee types (Full-Time and Part-Time), and a main Launch class that serves as the entry point of the application. The user can easily extend the system by adding more employee categories or modifying the salary calculation logic.

Key Features:

🧍 Manage employee information (name, ID, type, and salary details)

🕒 Calculate and display salary based on employment type:

Full-time employees receive fixed monthly pay

Part-time employees are paid based on hourly rates

⚙️ Uses OOP concepts for modular and reusable design

💾 Simple console-based interface for easy use

🚀 Main method present in Launch.java to run the program

Technologies Used:

Language: Java

Tools: Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or command-line compiler

Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Class & Object Design

Project Structure:
Employee_PayRoll_System/
│
├── Employee.java              → Base class for all employees
├── FullTimeEmployee.java      → Handles full-time employee logic
├── PartTimeEmployee.java      → Handles part-time employee logic
├── PayRollSystem.java         → Contains salary processing logic
├── Launch.java                → Main entry point (contains main method)
└── *.class                    → Compiled Java bytecode files

How to Run:

1.Compile all Java files:

javac *.java

2.Run the program using the Launch class:

java Launch

3.Follow the console prompts to enter employee details and view calculated payrolls.
